# ZYNCX PRIVACY MIXER - PROVER INPUTS (Multi-Token + Partial Withdrawals)
# =============================================================================
# This file contains example inputs for generating a withdrawal proof.
# In production, these values are generated by the client-side SDK.
#
# KEY FEATURES:
# -------------
# 1. Multi-Token Support: Each commitment includes a token_mint field
# 2. Partial Withdrawals: Withdraw any portion, keep the rest
# 3. Cross-Token Swaps: Use swap_circuit for SOL→USDC etc.
#
# COMMITMENT FORMAT: Poseidon(secret, nullifier_secret, amount, token_mint)
#
# Example: Deposit 10 SOL → Partial withdraw 3 SOL → 7 SOL change commitment
